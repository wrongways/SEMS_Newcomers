==== Levers for controlling frequency and power

===== In-band and out-of-band
Today's servers come with their own management system, known as the baseboard management controller
or more colloquially the *bmc*. Operations that are applied to a server, boot, shutdown etc that take
place via the bmc are said to be *out-of-band*. The same operations performed from the operating system
are said to be *in-band*.

Of the different interfaces that Smart Energy Management System uses the Intel runtime average power
limit (rapl) interface â€” see <<Intel rapl,rapl>> below is in-bandfootnote:[The Nvidia system management
interface (smi) for GPUs is also in-band, but this is not currently used by SEMS]. The other interfaces
described below are out-of-band, relying on the bmc. The current trend is to move away from in-band
monitoring and control towards more frequent use of out-of-band.


===== Intel rapl
The running average power limit (rapl) monitors and controls power for a CPU socket (package),
the cores, the uncores (processor components other than the cores), and main memory (DRAM).
Power consumption is sampled and averaged over a time window. The average is compared against
the user-defined thresholds. If any of the limits are exceeded the on-board power management
algorithm throttles the maximum CPU frequency accordingly. Power measurement is indirect through
a set of hardware counters.

Once limits have been set power consumption is managed by RAPL without intervention from an
external management system.

Capping and monitoring using rapl is in-band (from the operating system).


===== Data centre manageability interface (DCMI)
DCMI is an Intel standard for managing servers, including power through the baseboard management
controller (BMC). Compliant platforms allow external management tools to monitor and control server
power usage. The interface is coarse-grained compared to the running average power limit in that it
provides controls and monitors for the overall system power.

===== Intel Node Manager
Intel Node Manager is a replacement for DCMI. It also uses the BMC to send commands to the
on-chip management engine, with a subset of commands addressing power usage. It monitors
power usage from the server, provides controls for maximum server power and can automatically
reduce power consumption via CPU frequency.

===== DMTF Redfish
The distributed management task-force (DMTF) Redfish specification is an open standard that
can be considered a competitor to the Intel DCMI. The Redfish specification covers a wide
range of data centre management domains including server power and data centre power distribution.
